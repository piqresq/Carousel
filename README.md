## Hello! 👋
Welcome to my app! Hope you will like it, as I learned a lot and had tons of fun creating this! :)
## Running the app 🏃 
To run the app, do a repository clone. After that in terminal enter command "npm install" to install the dependencies.
Upon installation, the app is ready to be ran with the pre-installed command "npm start".
## About the content 📦
This Carousel app can run any content (images, video, audio).
It already has media files in it in the media folder.
To add any custom files, just throw them in that folder. (!The app only support mp3 and mp4 formats for audio and video, however this can be easily configured in webpack config).



## Have a good day! 🎠🎠🎠
